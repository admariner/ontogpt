Dentin is a major component of teeth that protects dental pulp and maintains tooth health. Bone morphogenetic protein 
(BMP) signaling is required for the formation of dentin. Mice lacking a BMP type I receptor, activin A receptor type 
1 (ACVR1), in the neural crest display a deformed mandible. Acvr1 is known to be expressed in the dental mesenchyme. 
However, little is known about how BMP signaling mediated by ACVR1 regulates dentinogenesis. To explore the role of 
ACVR1 in dentin formation in molars and incisors in mice, Acvr1 was conditionally disrupted in Osterix-expressing 
cells (designated as cKO). We found that loss of Acvr1 in the dental mesenchyme led to dentin dysplasia in molars and 
osteodentin formation in incisors. Specifically, the cKO mice exhibited remarkable tooth phenotypes characterized by 
thinner dentin and thicker predentin, as well as compromised differentiation of odontoblasts in molars. We also found 
osteodentin formation in the coronal part of the cKO mandibular incisors, which was associated with a reduction in 
the expression of odontogenic gene Dsp and an increase in the expression of osteogenic gene Bsp, leading to an 
alteration of cell fate from odontoblasts to osteoblasts. In addition, the expressions of WNT antagonists, Dkk1 and 
Sost, were downregulated and B-catenin was up-regulated in the cKO incisors, while the expression levels were not 
changed in the cKO molars, compared with the corresponding controls. Our results indicate the distinct and critical 
roles of ACVR1 between incisors and molars, which is associated with alterations in the WNT signaling related 
molecules. This study demonstrates for the first time the physiological roles of ACVR1 during dentinogenesis.
