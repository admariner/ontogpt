title: Drug Mechanism Template
description: >-
  A template for extracting information about drug mechanisms of action,
  including the diseases they treat, the drugs themselves, and the detailed
  mechanistic pathways by which drugs produce their therapeutic effects.
  This template captures subject-predicate-object relationships that describe
  how drugs interact with biological entities to achieve therapeutic outcomes.

  DrugMechanismSet:
    description: >-
      A collection of one or more drug mechanisms of action,
      each describing how a specific drug treats a particular
      disease through a series of mechanistic links.
    tree_root: true
    attributes:
      drug_mechanisms:
        description: >-
          A semicolon-delimited list of individual drug mechanisms
          of action included in this set. Include all details regarding
          the drug, disease, and specific proteins or pathways involved,
          but only those explicitly mentioned in the text.
          If a drug is involved in multiple mechanisms for the same or
          different diseases, each mechanism should be represented as a
          separate entry. If a drug is mentioned without a disease or a
          disease without a drug, this should still be captured as a mechanism
          without the missing element.
        multivalued: true
        range: DrugMechanism
        annotations:
          prompt.examples: ibuprofen inhibits COX-2, an enzyme involved in inflammation; Lipitor inhibits HMGCR; sertraline is used to treat major depressive disorder and sertraline inhibits SLC6A4; Omeprazole inhibits ATP4A, reducing stomach acid production; Metformin

  DrugMechanism:
    attributes:
      disease:
        description: >-
          The name of the disease or condition that is treated by the drug.
          This should be a specific disease entity rather than a general symptom.
          Omit any qualifiers such as "chronic" or "acute" unless they are part of
          the disease name itself.
        range: Disease
        examples:
          - value: Alzheimer disease
          - value: hypertension
          - value: major depressive disorder
      drug:
        description: >-
          The name of the pharmaceutical drug, medication, or therapeutic compound
          This can include brand names, generic names, or chemical compound names.
        range: Drug
        examples:
          - value: ibuprofen
          - value: Lipitor
          - value: sertraline
      mechanism_links:
        description: >-
          A semicolon-separated list of mechanistic links that explain how the drug works.
          This should only be based on the information explicitly mentioned in the text.
          Each link should be a triple connecting two biological entities via a relationship type.
          For example, this may be between a drug and a protein, a protein and a pathway,
          or a protein and another protein. Refer to each by the name used in the text.
        multivalued: true
        range: MechanismLink
        annotations:
          prompt.examples: ibuprofen inhibits COX-2; COX-2 involved in inflammatory response

        annotations:

  MechanismElement:
    description: >-
      A biological entity that participates in a drug mechanism of action.
      This can include genes, proteins, enzymes, receptors, pathways, 
      cellular components, or other molecular entities.

  MechanismLink:
    description: >-
      A mechanistic relationship that connects two biological entities through a specific
      relationship type, forming a subject-predicate-object triple. This represents
      one step or component in the overall mechanism of how a drug produces its therapeutic effect.

      subject:
        description: >-

      predicate:
        description: >-
          the type of relationship or interaction between the subject and object.
