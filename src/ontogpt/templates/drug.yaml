title: Drug Mechanism Template
description: >-
  A template for extracting information about drug mechanisms of action,
  including the diseases they treat, the drugs themselves, and the detailed
  mechanistic pathways by which drugs produce their therapeutic effects.
  This template captures subject-predicate-object relationships that describe
  how drugs interact with biological entities to achieve therapeutic outcomes.

    attributes:
      disease:
        description: >-
          The name of the disease condition that is treated by the drug.
          This should be a specific disease entity rather than a general symptom.
        range: Disease
        examples:
          - value: Alzheimer disease
          - value: hypertension
          - value: major depressive disorder
      drug:
        description: >-
          the name of the pharmaceutical drug, medication, or therapeutic compound
          that is used to treat the specified disease. This can include brand names,
          generic names, or chemical compound names.
        range: Drug
        examples:
          - value: ibuprofen
          - value: Lipitor
          - value: sertraline
      mechanism_links:
        description: >-
          semicolon-separated list of mechanistic links that explain how the drug works.
          Each link should be a triple connecting two biological entities via a relationship type,
          such as 'drug inhibits enzyme' or 'protein activates pathway'.
        multivalued: true
        range: MechanismLink
        annotations:
          prompt.examples: ibuprofen inhibits COX-2; COX-2 involved_in inflammatory response

  MechanismElement:
    description: >-
      A biological entity that participates in a drug mechanism of action.
      This can include genes, proteins, enzymes, receptors, pathways, 
      cellular components, or other molecular entities.

  Disease:
    description: >-
      A disease, disorder, condition, or pathological state that can be treated
      with pharmaceutical interventions. This includes both acute and chronic conditions,
      mental health disorders, and other medical conditions.
    is_a: NamedEntity
    annotations:
      annotators: sqlite:obo:mesh, sqlite:obo:mondo

  Drug:
    description: >-
      A pharmaceutical drug, medication, therapeutic compound, or other chemical substance
      used for medical treatment. This includes prescription drugs, over-the-counter medications,
      biologics, and experimental therapeutics.
    is_a: NamedEntity
    annotations:
      annotators: sqlite:obo:drugbank, sqlite:obo:chebi, sqlite:obo:mesh

  Predicate:
    description: >-
      A relationship type that describes how two biological entities interact
      in the context of a drug mechanism. Examples include 'inhibits', 'activates',
      'binds_to', 'regulates', or 'involved_in'.
    is_a: NamedEntity
    annotations:
      annotators: sqlite:obo:biolink, sqlite:obo:ro

  MechanismLink:
    description: >-
      A mechanistic relationship that connects two biological entities through a specific
      relationship type, forming a subject-predicate-object triple. This represents
      one step or component in the overall mechanism of how a drug produces its therapeutic effect.
    is_a: CompoundExpression
    attributes:
      subject:
        description: >-
          the source biological entity in the mechanistic relationship.
          This is typically the entity that performs or initiates the action.
        range: MechanismElement
      predicate:
        description: >-
          the type of relationship or interaction between the subject and object.
          This describes how the subject entity affects or relates to the object entity.
        range: Predicate
      object:
        description: >-
          the target biological entity in the mechanistic relationship.
          This is typically the entity that is affected by or receives the action.
        range: MechanismElement
