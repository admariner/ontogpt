      sections:
        range: DocumentSection

        description: >-
          A semicolon-separated list of full sections of the document.
          If semicolons are present in the section text, they should
          be replaced with (SEMICOLON) to avoid parsing errors.
          A section is a major division of the document, such as an abstract,
          introduction, methods, results, discussion, or conclusion,
          or a subsection of one of these. The text should include the section
          title. A single phrase or ID is not a section.
