            A semicolon-separated list of relationships
            between a single nutrient (including vitamins,
            minerals, and micronutrients) and a single
            disease, with a type of relationship connecting
            them both. Represent the relationship as
            triples, e.g., "Nutrient HAS RELATIONSHIP WITH
            Disease". Relationships may include TREATS,
            PREVENTS, INCREASES RISK OF, DECREASES RISK OF,
            or others.
