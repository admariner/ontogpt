      nutrient_to_disease_relationships:

        multivalued: true
        description: >-
          A list of relationships between nutrients and
          biochemical diseases.
        annotations:
          prompt: >-
            A semicolon-separated list of relationships
            between a single nutrient (including vitamins,
            minerals, and micronutrients) and a single
            disease, with a type of relationship connecting
            them both. A disease is any abnormal health condition
            (e.g., Alzheimer's disease, systemic lupus erythematosus,
            rheumatoid arthritis, sickle cell anemia, Barth syndrome).
            Represent the relationship as
            triples, e.g., "Nutrient HAS RELATIONSHIP WITH
            Disease". Relationships may include TREATS,
            PREVENTS, INCREASES RISK OF, DECREASES RISK OF,
            or others.
      nutrient_to_phenotype_relationships:
        range: NutrientToPhenotypeRelationship
        multivalued: true
        description: >-
          A list of relationships between nutrients and
          biological phenotypes.
        annotations:
          prompt: >-
            A semicolon-separated list of relationships
            between a single nutrient (including vitamins,
            minerals, and micronutrients) and a single
            biological phenotype, with a type of relationship
            connecting them both. A phenotype is an observable
            physical or behavioral trait or symptom (e.g., fever,
            headache, short attention span, petechiae,
            telangiectasia). It may or may not be associated
            with a disease. Phenotypes do NOT include high-level
            biological processes such as "Insulin signaling" or "lipid
            metabolism", developmental processes such as "limb development",
            or health states such as "healthy teeth". Represent the
            relationship as triples, e.g., "Nutrient HAS RELATIONSHIP
            WITH Phenotype". Relationships may include TREATS,
            PREVENTS, or others.
      nutrient_to_biological_process_relationships:
        range: NutrientToBiologicalProcessRelationship
        multivalued: true
        description: >-
          A list of relationships between nutrients and
          biological processes.
        annotations:
          prompt: >-
            A semicolon-separated list of relationships
            between a single nutrient (including vitamins,
            minerals, and micronutrients) and a single
            biological process, with a type of relationship
            connecting them both. A biological process is an
            activity or series of activities that occur in a
            cell or organism, such as "nuclear axial expansion",
            "intracellular transport", "ribosomal subunit export from nucleus",
            "insulin signaling", or "DNA repair".
            Biological processes do NOT include health states such as
            "healthy teeth". Represent the relationship as triples, e.g.,
            "Nutrient HAS RELATIONSHIP WITH Process". Relationships may include
            REGULATES, PARTICIPATES IN, or others.

            nutrient, with a type of relationship connecting
            them both. Represent the relationship as
            triples, e.g., "Nutrient INTERACTS WITH
            Nutrient".
