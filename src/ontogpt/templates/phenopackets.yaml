title: Phenopackets Schema v2
description: >-
  A template for extracting a phenopacket, an anonymous
  phenotypic description of an individual or biosample
  with potential genes of interest and/or diagnoses.
  This template is based on the Phenopackets schema v2,
  originally defined in Protobuf. All classes are
  defined in a single schema here, with their corresponding
  module provided in a comment (e.g., core/individual).

    description: >-
      An anonymous phenotypic description of an individual or biosample with potential genes of interest and/or diagnoses.
      This is a bundle of high-level concepts with no specifically defined relational concepts. It is expected that the
      resources sharing the phenopackets will define and enforce their own semantics and level of requirements for included
      fields.
    attributes:
      id:
        description: An identifier specific for this phenopacket.
        range: string
        annotations:
          prompt: >-
            A unique identifier. This must be generated and may not be
            provided in the input text.
          prompt.example: "THP-1 Control1"
      subject:
        description: >-
          The individual representing the focus of this packet - e.g. the proband in rare disease cases or cancer patient
        range: Individual
        annotations:
          prompt: >-
            The individual or biosample being described in the input text.

            individual or biosample.
      measurements:
        description: >-
          Quantifiable measurements related to the individual
        range: Measurement
        multivalued: true
        inlined: true
        annotations:
          prompt: >-
            A semicolon-separated list of measurements taken from the individual
            or biosample.
      biosample:
        description: >-
          Biosample(s) derived from the patient or a collection of biosamples in isolation
        range: Biosample
        multivalued: true
        inlined: true
        annotations:

          prompt: >-
            A semicolon-separated list of interpretations of the input text.
      diseases:
        description: >-
          Field for disease identifiers - could be used for listing either diagnosed or suspected conditions. The
          resources using these fields should define what this represents in their context.

        multivalued: true
        inlined: true
        annotations:
          prompt: >-

            conditions.
      medical_actions:
        description: >-
          Field for medical action identifiers - could be used for listing either performed or planned actions. The
