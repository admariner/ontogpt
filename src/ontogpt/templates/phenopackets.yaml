title: Phenopackets Schema v2
description: >-
  A template for extracting a phenopacket, an anonymous
  phenotypic description of an individual or biosample
  with potential genes of interest and/or diagnoses.
  This template is based on the Phenopackets schema v2,
  originally defined in Protobuf. All classes are
  defined in a single schema here, with their corresponding
  module provided in a comment (e.g., core/individual).

    description: >-
      An anonymous phenotypic description of an individual or biosample with potential genes of interest and/or diagnoses.
      This is a bundle of high-level concepts with no specifically defined relational concepts. It is expected that the
      resources sharing the phenopackets will define and enforce their own semantics and level of requirements for included
      fields.

          Individuals related in some way to the patient. For instance, the individuals may be genetically related or may

          genetically related individuals for use cases such as genomic diagnostics. If a phenopacket is being used to
