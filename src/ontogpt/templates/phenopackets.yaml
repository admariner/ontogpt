title: Phenopackets Schema v2
description: >-
  A template for extracting a phenopacket, an anonymous
  phenotypic description of an individual or biosample
  with potential genes of interest and/or diagnoses.
  This template is based on the Phenopackets schema v2,
  originally defined in Protobuf. All classes are
  defined in a single schema here, with their corresponding
  module provided in a comment (e.g., core/individual).
  Much of this modeling is adapted from Chris Mungall's
  linkml-phenopackets
  (see https://github.com/cmungall/linkml-phenopackets).

# NOTE: this is currently set up to extract details on
# a single patient at a time. Adapting to cohort-level
# extractions will require a container class and a
# mechanism for isolating specific patient details
# and linking them to the appropriate patient.
# See the "subject" slot in the Phenopacket class
# for the specific prompt as this restricts
# the extraction to a single patient.

# TODO: identify which fields should not be generated
# (these are usually the identifiers, and we want be
# be sure they won't get generated by an LLM)

# TODO: rethink how ontology terms are modeled here.
# The original schema uses an OntologyClass class to
# define the range of anything to be treated as a
# term + label. Not too different from a NamedEntity
# in the ontogpt core schema, but potentially redundant
# if a field will already be treated as a NamedEntity.

    description: >-
      A collection of phenopackets. Each phenopacket is a phenotypic
      description of an individual or biosample with potential genes of
      interest and/or diagnoses. Each phenopacket describes a single
      individual, experimental animal, or biosample.

      - This is not part of the Phenopackets Schema.
      - It is specific to the OntoGPT implementation.

  Biosample:

      A Biosample refers to a unit of biological material from which the
      substrate molecules (e.g. genomic DNA, RNA, proteins) for molecular
      analyses (e.g. sequencing, array hybridisation, mass-spectrometry) are
      extracted. Examples would be a tissue biopsy, a single cell from a
      culture for single cell genome sequencing or a protein fraction from a
      gradient centrifugation. Several instances (e.g. technical replicates) or
      types of experiments (e.g. genomic array as well as RNA-seq experiments)
      may refer to the same Biosample. FHIR mapping: Specimen
