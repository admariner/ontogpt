title: Template for extracting Alzheimer's Disease Phenotypes
description: >-
  Template for extracting phenotypes of Alzheimer's disease and related
  dementias along with experimental metrics and model organisms.
  Assumes a large input text, on the order of a full scientific article or
  review. Focus is on extracting the methods and metrics used
  with different model organisms. Try with this review - PMID:33302541

    attributes:
      sections:
        range: DocumentSection
        multivalued: true
        description: >-
          A semicolon-separated list of full sections of the document.
          If semicolons are present in the section text, they should
          be replaced with (SEMICOLON) to avoid parsing errors.
          A section is a major division of the document, such as an abstract,
          introduction, methods, results, discussion, or conclusion,
          or a subsection of one of these. The text should include the section
          title. A single phrase or ID is not a section.
          Do not format in Markdown.

    attributes:
      taxon:
        range: Taxon
        multivalued: true
        description: >-
          A semicolon-separated list of taxa or species of organisms
          mentioned in the section. Where possible, translate to the
          binomial species name (e.g., change "mouse" to "Mus musculus"),
          unless a different species name is provided in the text.
          If no taxa are mentioned, return NONE.
      summary:
        range: string
        description: >-
          A brief summary of the section, suitable for display in a table of
          contents or search results. This should be a single sentence or
          phrase, not a full paragraph. Do not format in Markdown.
      symptoms:
        range: Symptom
        multivalued: true
        description: >-
          A semicolon-separated list of symptoms mentioned in the section. These
          are signs of disease or other conditions that are experienced by a
          human or experimental model organism. They may include physical or
          behavioral signs. If no symptoms are mentioned, return NONE.
      diagnostics:
        range: Diagnostic
        multivalued: true
        description: >-
          A semicolon-separated list of diagnostic procedures mentioned in the
          section. If no diagnostic procedures are mentioned, return NONE.
      experimental_metrics:
        range: Metric
        multivalued: true
        description: >-
          A semicolon-separated list of experimental metrics or outcomes
          mentioned in the section. These may be quantitative or qualitative
          measures, including biomolecular assays. They measure the effects of
          treatments on symptoms or diagnostics, or of the progression of
          Alzheimer's disease and related dementias. For example,
          Amyloid beta (AÎ²) levels are a frequently used metric for assessing
          the progression of Alzheimer's disease. If no experimental metrics are
          mentioned, return NONE.
      taxon_experimental_metrics:
        description: >-
          Semicolon-separated list of associations between
          a specific taxon and an experimental metric used to measure
          progression of Alzheimer's disease and related dementias,
          or an experimental analogue, in the taxon. For example,
          synaptic density MEASURED_IN Mus musculus.
        multivalued: true
        range: TaxonExperimentalMetric
