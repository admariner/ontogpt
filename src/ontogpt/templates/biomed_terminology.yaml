      A document containing biomedical terminology, likely with
      a single term per line.

          All individual terms in the document, semicolon-separated.

  TermAndLocation:
    description: >-
      A term that may have a location associated with it.
    attributes:
      term:
        description: >-
          The term itself, e.g., "cardiac ecg", with no changes.
        range: string
      term_grounded:
        description: >-
          The term itself, e.g., "cardiac ecg". Don't change the term,
          this is just a copy of the term field so it can be edited
          in a subsequent step.
        range: GroundedTerm
      location:
        description: >-
          The anatomical location associated with the term, if any.
          For example, "heart" for "cardiac ecg".
          Don't provide multiple locations, e.g., don't provide
          "retina or eye", just provide "retina" or "eye".
          If not specified, do not provide a value for this field.
