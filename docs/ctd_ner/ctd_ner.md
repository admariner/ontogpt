# ctd_ner

A template for Chemical and Disease named entity recognition.
This template is intended to represent entities (chemicals and diseases), and for evaluating SPIRES against the BioCreative V Disease Named Entity Recognition (DNER) results. As the test set also contains chemical names, it is also appropriate to use this template for evaluating chemical NER.
