# Slot: experimental_metrics_to_taxon_relationships


_Semicolon-separated list of relationships between a specific experimental metric, sign, symptom, or outcome and a taxon, as described in the input text. These are cases in which the relationship is used to measure progression of Alzheimer's disease and related dementias, or an experimental analogue, in the taxon. For example, "Amyloid beta (Aβ) levels are measured in Mus musculus" or "Morris water maze test is measured with Rattus norvegicus".  Include all qualifiers and whether the relationship is direct or indirect._
