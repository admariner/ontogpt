# Slot: experimental_metric_to_chemical_relationships


_Semicolon-separated list of relationships between a specific experimental metric, sign, symptom, or outcome and a chemical, drug, or other substance, as described in the input text. These are cases in which the relationship is used to measure the effects of a chemical on the progression of Alzheimer's disease and related dementias, or an experimental analogue. For example, "Amyloid beta (Aβ) levels are measured in response to donepezil" or "Morris water maze test is measured in response to caffeine". Include all qualifiers, whether the relationship was direct or indirect, and any observed associations, including whether the association was positive, negative, or inconclusive._
