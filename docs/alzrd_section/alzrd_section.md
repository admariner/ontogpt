# alzrd_section

Template for extracting phenotypes of Alzheimer's disease and related dementias along with experimental metrics and model organisms. Assumes a large input text, on the order of a full scientific article or review. Focus is on extracting the methods and metrics used with different model organisms. This template will attempt to break up the input text by section before parsing, as opposed to parsing the entire text at once.
