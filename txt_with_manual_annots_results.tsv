Differential diagnosis, ranked by likelihood:

1. Senile systemic amyloidosis: This condition is associated with biventricular myocardial wall thickening and symptoms like dyspnea, fatigue, and atrial fibrillation. It often progresses slowly and can lead to heart block and ventricular arrhythmias. Its incidence increases with age, particularly in males.

2. Hypertrophic cardiomyopathy: This condition could explain the wall thickening and regurgitation. However, it is usually associated with exertional symptoms and arrhythmias.

3. Cardiac sarcoidosis: Although rare, especially in the elderly, the wall thickening, arrhythmias, and progressive mitral regurgitation seen in this patient could potentially be due to cardiac sarcoidosis.

4. Constrictive pericarditis: This condition can cause similar symptoms to this patient's, including heart block, pedal edema, and atrial fibrillation.

5. Endocardial fibroelastosis: This too could cause ventricular and myocardial thickening, albeit it is uncommon in adults. 

6. Primary myocardial disease: Conditions such as dilated cardiomyopathy could progress to cause biventricular failure, evidenced by pedal edema and heart block in this patient.


7. Cardiac amyloidosis: This condition often presents in the elderly and can cause thickening of the heart walls and progressive heart failure.
   
8. Myocardial infarction: The patient's age, along with symptoms of chest pain, nausea, and dyspnea, hint at the possibility of coronary artery disease and myocardial infarction. Nonetheless, wall thickening isn't typically associated with this condition.

9. Transient ischemic attack or stroke: Symptoms such as tinnitus, dizziness, and vertigo could suggest transient ischemic attacks, but the patient lacks other typical symptoms such as arm or face weakness.

10. Fabry’s disease: While this disease can cause left ventricular hypertrophy and arrhythmias, it's unlikely given the age of the patient and lack of typical presentation.

A contrast CT scan showed enlarged mediastinal lymph nodes. Necrotizing pneumonia and pleural effusion were noticed upon chest X-ray. A test for severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) returned positive and a subsequent chest CT revealed bilateral ground-glass opacities.
