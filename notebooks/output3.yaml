  Zambia and the DR Congo are situated in the central African Copperbelt, which is part of the Lufilian geological structure arc stretching over from Kolwezi in Katanga Province in the DRC to Luanshya in Copperbelt Province in Zambia. The area has large copper-cobalt deposits of which the extraction causes severe ecosystem damage due to pollution of water, food crops, and the ambient air negatively impacting population health. Contamination of drinking water for domestic use and foods (cereals, roots and tubers, vegetables, and fruits) was determined by assessing the contents of trace metals including Mn, Ni, Pb, Zn, Co, As, U, Cd, and Cu and through a questionnaire for environmental damage. Food samples were analyzed by inductively coupled argon plasma/optical emission spectroscopy (ICP-OES), while water and urine samples were analyzed by inductively coupled argon plasma mass spectrometry (ICP-MS). Concentrations of Ni, Pb, and Cd were higher in almost all food crops, although Cu was more in samples of Cucurbita maxima and Amaranthus hybridus. Mean contents (μg/L) of Mn, Zn, Cd, Pb, and U were, respectively, 5,454.6, 2552.2, 138.7, 39.7, 2361.1, and 21.4 in the DRC and 108.9, 543.3, 0.3, 0.2, 1.5, and 0.5 in Zambia, being significantly higher and always far above World Health Organization maximum limits in the DRC. Urine samples taken only from the DRC contained trace metals with children's samples being more contaminated than adult ones. Our results conclusively echo the most critical challenges of toxic pollutants causing numerous health issues among the population. Given an outcry among households adjacent to mines about land degradation and food spoilage, and health problems over years, joint efforts are needed from public and private sectors for stringent mining exploitation monitoring for sustainable governance to protect the environment and ensure food and nutrition safety, and population well-being in Zambia and the DR Congo.Copyright © 2022 A. Muimba-Kankolongo et al.  1. Introduction Zambia and the DR Congo (DRC) are situated in the central African Copperbelt region, which is part of the Lufilian geological structure arc that stretches over more than 500 km from Kolwezi in the former Katanga Province in the DRC to Luanshya in Copperbelt Province in Zambia [1]. The arc contains large reserves of copper and cobalt minerals [2], which represent the mainstay of the two countries' economy [3–8]. With about 28% contribution to the GNP and 70% export value [6], mining exploitation remains the main source of DRC's foreign currencies [6, 7]. Similarly, the mining sector is Zambia's most sensitive economic sector owing to its linkage to the export market, and copper contributes about 70% of foreign earnings [9]. The mining industry only contributes about 9.90% to GDP, 77% to export earnings, and 27.77% to country employment [10]. Besides public and private industrial mining, artisanal mine productions are also widespread [11–15] and often work in the form of cooperatives of artisan miners—also known as formal artisanal mining—leading to the establishment of a middle class of Congolese and Zambians contributing to the integrated development of grassroot communities. They operate on industrial mining concessions using nonstandard extraction practices such as sieving the soil in rivers, thereby causing severe environmental pollution. There are currently numerous public, parastatal, and private companies and informal artisanal mining operating in the mining sector in Zambia and in the DRC [7, 14, 15]. Brummett et al. [16] recorded the reduction in water quality through mining pollution as a major threat to freshwater ecosystems, and Banks et al. [17] and Pulles et al. [18] noted that discharges of contaminants in water resources constitute the main environmental challenges to most mining exploitations. Much of the sub-Saharan Africa including the central Africa Copperbelt comprises more poor rural communities that depend on agriculture for livelihoods and as an important source of commodities' exports and intraregional trade [19]. The agricultural sector in the region is dominated by crop production mainly by smallholder farmers—because of the climate change that has exacerbated weather variability—over-depending on rainfed agricultural production of roots and tubers, plantains, maize, rice, groundnuts, beans, sorghum, millets, and vegetables [19–22]. Estimates from the World Bank [23] indicate that the value addition to GDP attributable to agriculture in the DRC and Zambia is 42.9% and 21.6%, respectively. About 75% of the population is engaged in agriculture, largely subsistence farming that contributes about 60% to the overall production output [24]. Nevertheless, the performance of agriculture in the central Africa Copperbelt region in terms of food production and security has been lacking far behind mainly due to recurrent prolonged droughts, making food insecurity a major challenge [25, 26]. Moreover, food security is compromised by the degradation of farmlands and the environment resulting from mineral extractions [27], often culminating in food shortages and famine. The community's inhabitants are perpetually prone to hunger, malnutrition, and poverty. Contaminants from mines and metallurgic industries pollute water, soil, and the ambient air affecting the growth pattern and well-being, especially for children. For decades, mining activities including construction, exploitation, and maintenance have caused severe damage to the regional ecosystem resulting in land-use change and associated negative impacts on environments such as deforestation, erosion, alteration of agricultural soil properties, contamination of local streams and wetlands, and an increase in noise level, dust, and smoke plume emissions [27, 28]. Pollution of the ambient air from industrial activities caused mainly by pollutants being transported over long distances after their release into the environment has also been the source of health concerns. Other negative impact communities living on fringe of the mines endure include the impacts on rainfall pattern modification becoming less and often starting late in the year leading to the decline of the forest cover and considerably decreasing forest resources used for their well-being [27, 29, 30]. Health threats posed to residents from prolonged exposure to toxic trace metals and metalloid can only be determined by their daily dietary intake through ingestion and inhalation pathways. Individuals' life span trend and their well-being could also serve as broad indicators for their physiological food uptake, digestion, and storage as well [31, 32]. Numerous studies have been carried out in the DRC in relation to human body accumulation of pollutants and showed high amounts of pollutants in the blood and urine of inhabitants in the mining areas including mineworkers, residents of an urban neighbourhood that had been transformed into an artisanal cobalt mine, and children with strong evidence of exposure-related oxidative DNA damage [15, 33, 34]. In contrast in Zambia, only investigations in children suffering from lead poisoning are well established in the plomb mining area in Kabwe town that has left a legacy of significant environmental pollution [28, 35]. Aside from the threat of increased and prolonged exposure to trace metal contaminants in food crops that were sampled in this study, we also acknowledged that local communities in the two countries have a varied and diversified food staples depending on ethnicity, culture, and where they live. Hence, our study could have also included foods such as fresh, frozen, and smoked fish, fresh and smoked meat (goat, chicken, beef, pork), eggs, eggplants, rape, okra, poultry, caterpillars, grasshoppers and flying termites, and lentils that are commonly utilized in the diet to fully evaluate the body burden of trace metals among the devastated populations. Although ambient air pollution has been thoroughly investigated by others [15, 36–40], data on the identification and distribution of metal particle size are critically needed both from emission sources and in the ambient air. Particle size data on trace metals can be used to appraise the efficiency of emission control devices, evaluate the inhalation hazard, determine the timing of metals in the atmosphere, and assess visibility reduction and for a wide range of other applications including understanding atmospheric transformations. Given the enormous scale of damage to the ecosystems resulting from mineral extraction and operations of metallurgic industries that generate hazardous wastes containing dissolved toxic metals over the years, there has been an outcry among households adjacent to mines about land degradation, water and air pollution, and food spoilage. This study was carried out to investigate the perceptions of inhabitants living around mining areas and other stakeholders as regards the environmental and social impacts on the communities from industrial activities with the objectives to improve the population health and livelihood.   2. Materials and Methods  2.1. Study Sites This study was concentrated in the copper-cobalt producing areas of Zambia and the DRC (Figure 1) from September 2010 to September 2012 to enable a cross-country assessment of landscape pollution and impacts on population health. They were Haut-Katanga Province (Lat. 11°39′52.84″S, Long. 27°28′46.38 E, Alt. 1239 m) in the southeastern DRC where Gécamines—the state mining company—with its subsidiary industries have huge concessions covering approximately 30,000 km2 around the towns of Likasi (Central Group), Kipushi (Southwest Group), and Lubumbashi (East Group), and the Copperbelt Province in Zambia (Lat. 13°03′25.23″S, Long. 27°32′58.50″E, Alt.

  1247 m) where various companies including Konkola Copper Mines (KCM), Nchanga Mines, Mopani Copper Mines, Chambishi Metals, Roan Antelope Mining Corporation, and Luanshya and Kansanshi Mines extract minerals. KCM, one of the largest mining companies belonging to Vedanta, operates underground mines and open-pit mines and metallurgical plants with operations located on one of the highest-grade copper seams at Nchanga, Konkola, and Nkana in Kitwe and Nampundwe. A total of three sampling locations were specifically selected within each country based on recent proliferation of mines and previous reports on environmental contamination from plant effluents, spills, and tailings dam discharges and to have a wide distribution of sampling sites across the two countries. They were cities of Lubumbashi and Likasi, and Kipushi Territory in Haut-Katanga Province in the DRC, and Chingola, Kitwe, and Luanshya Districts in Zambia. Within each location, several sites were identified for sampling either in the proximity of intense mining and metallurgic activities or far away as controls based on the premises of past farmland degradation, potential degrees of high or low exposure, easy accessibility, and avoiding health risk due to possible irradiation from dangerous mining areas. They included Kabecha, Tshansansa, and Kasongo sites in Lubumbashi; SNCC-Shituru, Gécamines-Shituru, and Panda cities, and Kansalabwe village in Likasi; and Mungoshi and Douane areas, Betty City, Kampemba farm, and Nkumanwa village in Kipushi for the DRC. In Zambia, they were Shimulala, Heleni-Kasenji, Kalipenta, Pule, and Chama villages in Chingola; Roan area, and Mpatamatu and Mwansa villages in Luanshya; and Chankalamu village and Wusakile and Nkana West compounds in Kitwe.   2.2. Approaches to Sample Collection and Analysis  2.2.1. Collection and Analysis of Food Crop Samples Prioritised samples that were at the full stage of development were collected with permission in residents' gardens following the sites mapping around mine areas and far away and local harvesting practices, considering grains, leaves, stems, tubers/roots, and bulbs as plant parts for laboratory analysis. Precautions were taken to have both women and men during the briefing, which focused on hazardous chemicals for which long-term exposure might have potential effects on their health. After harvest, samples were immediately kept in paper bags, labeled accordingly, and kept in a refrigerator. In total, the samples included root and tuber crops (n = 48), leafy vegetables (n = 143), fruits (n = 51), bulbs (n = 5), and other plants (n = 33) that are also locally consumed. Out of these, 205 were from areas of intense mining and metallurgic industry activities, whereas 75 were derived from areas distant from these activities. Collected samples were pretreated individually by rinsing twice in running tap water and 3-4 times with sterile distilled water to remove any soil particles and other plant debris from fields and blotted dry before slicing into small pieces using a sterile knife. They were then oven-dried at 70°C to constant weight for 48 hours and separately homogenized by mechanical grinding using sterile porcelain mortars and pestles made from China. The weight of each sample powder was recorded before wrapping it in minigrip bags, which were maintained at room ambient temperature for further use. Thereafter, study samples were air-dispatched to soil and occupational and medicinal laboratories in Belgium for analysis. As described by Muimba-Kankolongo et al. [31], ground oven-dried powder samples of various food crops were crushed and sequentially digested in HNO3 (3 successive runs of dissolution in HNO3 (1 mL Suprapur 70%) followed by evaporation to dryness for 4 h at 110°C) and by microwave heating (250 W × 5 min; 400 W × 5 min; 650 W × 10 min; 250 W × 5 min) and then left to cool, and contents were filtered through Whatman filter paper no. 42 and kept in a final solution of 2% HCl and analyzed for total metal content by inductively coupled plasma/optical emission spectroscopy (ICP-OES, Perkin-Elmer Optima 3300 DV, Norwalk, CT, USA) in the Louvain Centre for Toxicology and Applied Pharmacology (Université catholique de Louvain, Belgium). At concentrations of b5 μg·Co/L in the digest, measurements were made by ICP-MS (Thermo X Series I) in He mode using Ga internal standard. Certified reference material NIST SRM-1573a (tomato leaves, National Institute of Standards and Technology, Gaithersburg, Germany, certified value = 0.57 mg Co/kg; measured value = 0.54 ± 0.01 mg·Co/kg) was included in duplicate with each analysis. Contents of 20 different trace elements and metalloids were determined, among which those of major concern in foods [32–34] included Mn, Ni, Pb, Zn, Co, As, U, Cd, and Cu. Metals and metalloids released by the digestion were added to NH4I solution, extracted by MIBK-TBP (80 : 20), and then stripped with H2O2 (5%), HNO3 (0.5%), and NH4H2PO4 (0.1%). Quantification was done by injecting aliquots of sample solutions (10 μL) into a carbon rod atomizer of an atomic absorption spectrophotometer with a variable detector set at 0.5 absorbance unit full scale and the results expressed in mg/kg of dry matter of each crop species.   2.2.2. Collection and Analysis of Water Samples For water samples, every effort was made to maintain a high degree of cleanliness for all equipment including bottles, containers, and rope and filtering equipment. At each location, water samples were collected in areas near mining activities or metallurgical factories (n = 43), but also in areas far from mining or mineral processing sites (n = 23) from rivers (n = 13), domestic wells or boreholes (n = 43) and taps (n = 23) in the districts of Chingola (n = 21), Kitwe (n = 11), and Luanshya (n = 10) in Zambia and in the cities of Lubumbashi (n = 6) and Likasi (n = 19), and the Kipushi Territory (n = 9) in the DRC always between 8 and 11 h. There were 205 samples collected in the fringe areas of mining activities and 75 control samples from areas far from mining and metallurgical industries. For surface rivers, the sampling was always at midstream or in the main flow and away from slumping and scouring effects found near the banks. The sampling bottle was uncapped immediately before sampling and plunged into the river with the opening facing upstream into the current until it was filled. Then, it was lifted out of water, decanted for a small amount if required, and recapped immediately ensuring hands did not come into contact with the insides of the bottles or caps. Adequate water quantities were obtained from a full flow out of faucets/taps after taps or pumps were left to run for at least two minutes to clear the line (Figure 2). Water was slowly filled in 40 mL clean polystyrene bottles with leak-proof screw caps (Plastiques Gosselin, Hazebrouck, France) to below the container rim before tightening the lids securely. In the deep dug boreholes or wells, water was obtained using tins cut on one side or plastic containers connected to long wooden canes with wire or rope (Figure 2) and filled in the polystyrene bottles. Samples were then pipetted into 1.5 mL Eppendorf tubes using micropipettes and transported in cooler boxes to the laboratory to be stored in the refrigerator at −20°C to retard potential chemical and biological changes before shipping in sealed cooler boxes with ice packs for analysis. Collected samples were filtered (0.45 μm) and measured by ICP-OES. The NIST certified water was included (certified value = 27 μg Co/L, measured value = 26 ± 1 μg·Co/L). Prior to analysis, water samples were filtered using a μm micropore membrane filter (0.45 μm) to avoid clogging the atomizer burner and then trace metal contents were quantified following the description by Muimba-Kankolongo et al. [31]. In particular, they were analyzed using inductively coupled argon plasma mass spectrometry (ICP-MS) with the lowest detection limit of 0.5 ppb (Perkin-Elmer Optima 3300 DV, Norwalk, CT, USA). The NIST-certified water was included (certified value = 27 μg Co/L, measured value = 26 ± 1 μg Co/L). Detection limits for all samples are calculated as twice the standard deviation of 6 preparation blank sample measurements as described by Cheyns et al. [39]. For values below the detection limits, half of the detection limit of each trace element was considered and the results were expressed in μg/L of water.   2.2.3. Collection and Analysis of Urine Samples Urine samples were obtained only from the DRC and not in Zambia because of some administrative issues with the Ministry of Health. Donors of urine samples included females and males among them there were children and adults. The youngest was 2 years old, while the oldest was 58 years old. The collection was from community members composed of infants and children over 2 years old (n = 9), adolescents (n = 4), adults (n = 13), and the elderly (n = 3) in Kabesha and Kawama locations in Lubumbashi following procedures previously described by Banza Lubaba et al. [37]. The collection was during the whole day often with assistance from local health personnel, and participants—both parents and children—were duly informed of the need for urine in the study before samples were collected and their participation was purely based on their willingness. During collection, instructions were provided to participants on how to perform a proper collection to avoid external contamination of the urine. After collection, an aliquot of 5 N hydrochloric acid was added to prevent decomposition and loss of metals by precipitation and then immediately stored in a cooler box and taken to the laboratory for storage in a refrigerator until transportation to Belgium for analysis, using commercial flights.
