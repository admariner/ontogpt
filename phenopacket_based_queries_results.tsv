This patient will benefit from observation for  the development of a recurrent depressive or anxiety disorder, as well as attention to address her  understandable emotional distress.

3. Gastroenteritis: Would primarily explain the gastrointestinal symptoms (diarrhea, vomiting, nausea, poor appetite), as well as a general malaise like fever, myalgia.
4. Kawasaki disease: Common in children and teenagers. It can present with fever, diarrhea, vomiting, myalgia, and chest pain due to myocarditis and associated EKG changes.
5. Acute pericarditis: Fever, chest pain, and EKG changes could be due to inflammation of the pericardium around the heart.
6. Neoplastic conditions: The nevus could be a sign of a paraneoplastic syndrome, causing a variety of the listed symptoms, though this is less likely without more specific signs of malignancy.
7. Eosinophilic gastroenteritis: Would primarily account for gastrointestinal symptoms but eosinophilia can cause myocardial involvement as well. Quite rare though.

The centrilobular nodules and  tree-in-bud pattern of opacities seen on this patient’s imaging studies are consistent with aspiration. In addition, this patient had secretions in  the airways, mucus plugging, a hiatal hernia, and  some residual contrast material in the esophagus,  all of which are suggestive of aspiration of oral  and gastric contents into the airways. His clinical history, especially the history of GERD and a  bitter taste in the mouth, suggests the occurrence of aspiration.

The BAL fluid  was notable for acute inflammation and the  presence of squamous cells, candida, and bacteria, findings that are consistent with — although  not specific for — aspiration of oral contents.

The most likely diagnosis in this patient is  IBD. His initial vague gastrointestinal symptoms  are atypical of this condition; however, arthralgias and oral aphthous ulcers are both common  extraintestinal manifestations. He did not have  frankly bloody stools, which could explain why  the hemoglobin level was only mildly decreased.  The decreased albumin level and mildly elevated  lipase level are consistent with a diagnosis of  IBD, and the elevated levels of inflammatory  markers support the diagnosis. Several features of this patient’s presentation  give me pause. Presentation with arthralgias as  the dominant symptom and with only mild gastrointestinal symptoms is highly unusual, as is  the fact that the most affected joint was his  shoulder. Also, he did not have a history of weight  loss or growth failure; the absence of these features suggests a recent and rapid onset of illness.

Because the liver is the common  venous drainage point for most of the gastrointestinal tract, it is a frequent site of hematogenous metastases, which appear as hypodense  lesions on CT. This patient initially had breakthrough heartburn that did not respond to previously effective  acid-suppression therapy, which could represent  malignant infiltration of the clasplike sling fibers  that originate from the upper stomach and form  part of the normal acid barrier. Malignant infiltration of the submucosal and muscularis propria layers of the fundus impairs normal gastric  accommodation, which leads to early satiation.  Malignant infiltration of the entire antral wall  disrupts the neurocircuitry and muscular contractions that are required for gastric emptying.  This process initially mimics gastroparesis, with  retention of solid food and nausea, but prokinetic treatments are ineffective because damage  to the muscularis propria prevents these agents  from effectively triggering antral contractions.  Liquids are initially tolerated because they are  emptied passively. However, progressive antral  disease marks a transition from gastroparesis  to gastric-outlet obstruction, and liquids are no  longer tolerated. Patients with linitis plastica  frequently present with advanced disease, and  this patient’s hypodense liver lesions may suggest metastatic disease. Given this patient’s rapidly progressive symptoms that are suggestive of specific alterations  in gastric physiology, in combination with his  imaging and EGD findings, I favor a diagnosis  of gastric cancer that is consistent with linitis  plastica.
