Leukopenia is present  in the majority of patients; the white-cell count  in this patient was near the low end of the normal range. No findings on chest CT are specific  for anaplasmosis. The CT findings observed in  this case (interlobular septal thickening, groundglass opacities, and pleural effusions) are nonspecific and can be seen with a wide array of  atypical infections, as well as noninfectious  causes. The main contribution of the imaging  findings in this case was to assist in ruling out  other possible explanations of the patient’s symptoms, such as typical bacterial pneumonia. Human ehrlichiosis may mimic anaplasmosis,  but one third of patients with ehrlichiosis have a  maculopapular or petechial rash, which was not  present in this patient. Also, ehrlichiosis is less  likely to be associated with thrombocytopenia  than is human granulocytic anaplasmosis. On  the basis of the constellation of these findings,  I overcame my bias toward Covid-19 and considered tickborne infection, particularly anaplasmosis, to be the most likely diagnosis in this  patient. To establish this diagnosis, we performed additional testing, including blood testing for Lyme disease antibodies, an examination  of thick and thin blood smears for babesia, and  nucleic acid testing for  A. phagocytophilum  DNA.
