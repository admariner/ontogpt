PMID_35584159-phenopacket-time-based_query.txt	In pulmonary medicine, we have a saying that  “everyone aspirates.” Aspiration can be clinically  silent and can occur even in the absence of overt  reflux symptoms. The centrilobular nodules and  tree-in-bud pattern of opacities seen on this patient’s imaging studies are consistent with aspiration. In addition, this patient had secretions in  the airways, mucus plugging, a hiatal hernia, and  some residual contrast material in the esophagus,  all of which are suggestive of aspiration of oral  and gastric contents into the airways. His clinical history, especially the history of GERD and a  bitter taste in the mouth, suggests the occurrence of aspiration. This patient’s waxing and  waning clinical course would also be consistent  with aspiration into the airways. The BAL fluid  was notable for acute inflammation and the  presence of squamous cells, candida, and bacteria, findings that are consistent with — although  not specific for — aspiration of oral contents.  Given this presentation, additional testing is  warranted. On the basis of this patient’s clinical presentation and radiographic evaluation, infectious  and aspiration bronchiolitis are the most likely  diagnoses in this case. A thorough microbiologic workup was negative except for the fungal  markers. The clinical and radiographic presentations are most consistent with a diffuse aspiration bronchiolitis; however, given this patient’s  degree of immunosuppression and positive fungal markers, I would proceed with a lung biopsy  to rule out fungal pneumonia and to confirm  the diagnosis of aspiration bronchiolitis.

PMID_35081284-phenopacket-time-based_query.txt	Children with IBD often “fall  off” the growth curve long before the diagnosis  is made. An early sign of growth failure is a  decrease in height velocity. The most likely diagnosis in this patient is  IBD. His initial vague gastrointestinal symptoms  are atypical of this condition; however, arthralgias and oral aphthous ulcers are both common  extraintestinal manifestations. He did not have  frankly bloody stools, which could explain why  the hemoglobin level was only mildly decreased.  The decreased albumin level and mildly elevated  lipase level are consistent with a diagnosis of  IBD, and the elevated levels of inflammatory  markers support the diagnosis. Several features of this patient’s presentation  give me pause. Presentation with arthralgias as  the dominant symptom and with only mild gastrointestinal symptoms is highly unusual, as is  the fact that the most affected joint was his  shoulder. Also, he did not have a history of weight  loss or growth failure; the absence of these features suggests a recent and rapid onset of illness.

The CT findings observed in  this case (interlobular septal thickening, groundglass opacities, and pleural effusions) are nonspecific and can be seen with a wide array of  atypical infections, as well as noninfectious  causes.

Because the liver is the common  venous drainage point for most of the gastrointestinal tract, it is a frequent site of hematogenous metastases, which appear as hypodense  lesions on CT. This patient initially had breakthrough heartburn that did not respond to previously effective  acid-suppression therapy, which could represent  malignant infiltration of the clasplike sling fibers  that originate from the upper stomach and form  part of the normal acid barrier. Malignant infiltration of the submucosal and muscularis propria layers of the fundus impairs normal gastric  accommodation, which leads to early satiation.  Malignant infiltration of the entire antral wall  disrupts the neurocircuitry and muscular contractions that are required for gastric emptying.  This process initially mimics gastroparesis, with  retention of solid food and nausea, but prokinetic treatments are ineffective because damage  to the muscularis propria prevents these agents  from effectively triggering antral contractions.  Liquids are initially tolerated because they are  emptied passively. However, progressive antral  disease marks a transition from gastroparesis  to gastric-outlet obstruction, and liquids are no  longer tolerated. Patients with linitis plastica  frequently present with advanced disease, and  this patient’s hypodense liver lesions may suggest metastatic disease. Given this patient’s rapidly progressive symptoms that are suggestive of specific alterations  in gastric physiology, in combination with his  imaging and EGD findings, I favor a diagnosis  of gastric cancer that is consistent with linitis  plastica.

The underlying principles are  that persons with psychiatric disorders need to  be identified and connected with appropriate psychiatric care and that the distress of other members of affected populations is best addressed  through psychosocial interventions, such as psychological first aid, without labeling the normative responses to disaster trauma as abnormal.  This patient will benefit from observation for  the development of a recurrent depressive or anxiety disorder, as well as attention to address her  understandable emotional distress. A mental  health professional can assess any psychiatric  illness that may develop and can assist in the  psychosocial aspects of her recovery from her  illness through psychotherapeutic interventions  including psychosocial support, education, reassurance, and assistance with resumption of her  previous level of functioning. In my opinion, this patient is having understandable psychosocial distress in the context  of a serious medical illness during the Covid-19  pandemic. The key to understanding this case is  to acknowledge that this patient’s distress is a  normative response and does not meet criteria  for a psychiatric diagnosis.
