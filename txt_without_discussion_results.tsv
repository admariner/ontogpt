The most likely diagnosis in this patient is  IBD. His initial vague gastrointestinal symptoms  are atypical of this condition; however, arthralgias and oral aphthous ulcers are both common  extraintestinal manifestations. He did not have  frankly bloody stools, which could explain why  the hemoglobin level was only mildly decreased.  The decreased albumin level and mildly elevated  lipase level are consistent with a diagnosis of  IBD, and the elevated levels of inflammatory  markers support the diagnosis. Several features of this patient’s presentation  give me pause. Presentation with arthralgias as  the dominant symptom and with only mild gastrointestinal symptoms is highly unusual, as is  the fact that the most affected joint was his  shoulder.

The CT findings observed in  this case (interlobular septal thickening, groundglass opacities, and pleural effusions) are nonspecific and can be seen with a wide array of  atypical infections, as well as noninfectious  causes.

Because the liver is the common  venous drainage point for most of the gastrointestinal tract, it is a frequent site of hematogenous metastases, which appear as hypodense  lesions on CT. This patient initially had breakthrough heartburn that did not respond to previously effective  acid-suppression therapy, which could represent  malignant infiltration of the clasplike sling fibers  that originate from the upper stomach and form  part of the normal acid barrier. Malignant infiltration of the submucosal and muscularis propria layers of the fundus impairs normal gastric  accommodation, which leads to early satiation.  Malignant infiltration of the entire antral wall  disrupts the neurocircuitry and muscular contractions that are required for gastric emptying.  This process initially mimics gastroparesis, with  retention of solid food and nausea, but prokinetic treatments are ineffective because damage  to the muscularis propria prevents these agents  from effectively triggering antral contractions.  Liquids are initially tolerated because they are  emptied passively. However, progressive antral  disease marks a transition from gastroparesis  to gastric-outlet obstruction, and liquids are no  longer tolerated. Patients with linitis plastica  frequently present with advanced disease, and  this patient’s hypodense liver lesions may suggest metastatic disease. Given this patient’s rapidly progressive symptoms that are suggestive of specific alterations  in gastric physiology, in combination with his  imaging and EGD findings, I favor a diagnosis  of gastric cancer that is consistent with linitis  plastica. The diagnostic test of choice would be  endoscopic ultrasonography (EUS).	"Most Likely Diagnosis:

However, the lack of genital lesions, negative pathergy test, and time course of disease progression with worsening symptoms despite steroid treatment may argue against it.
2. Pemphigus Vulgaris: The presence of oral ulcers, involvement of lip mucosa and skin lesions suggestive of bullae, and slight elevations in desmoglein titers could point towards Pemphigus Vulgaris, however, the absence of typical flaccid bullae seems questionable.
3. Chronic Ulcerative Stomatitis: This disease is similar to lichen planus and usually presents with resistant oral ulcers, but the skin biopsy did not show the characteristic interface mucositis.
4. Erythema Multiforme: The transient oral ulcers, trunk lesions, and the history of recent medication changes may point towards this disease.
5. Pathogen-induced conditions such as Oral Tuberculosis or Syphilis: The findings of oropharyngeal ulcer and systemic symptoms raise suspicions of microbial pathogens, but this seems unlikely given that the patient is immunocompetent and doesn't have associated risk factors.
6. Oral Squamous Cell Carcinoma (SCC): This could cause painful oral ulceration and weight loss but would not explain the other signs and symptoms.
7. Paraneoplastic Pemphigus: Peculiar oral ulcerations and cutaneous lesions are present, but no evidence of malignancy is reported.
8. Systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE): Given the positive ANA, oral ulcers, and skin lesions, SLE could be a possibility but seems less likely, considering other clinical findings and serologies. 
9. Drug reaction with eosinophilia and systemic symptoms (DRESS) syndrome: The peripheral eosinophilia and skin rash could suggest DRESS, but given the lack of fever and organ involvement, it seems less probable.
10. Bullous drug eruption or fixed drug eruption: Considering the history of new medications prior to manifestation of symptoms, this could also be considered less likely. 
11. Autoimmune blistering diseases such as Bullous pemphigoid or Dermatitis herpetiformis can present with skin lesions and oral symptoms but don't fully correlate clinically.
12. Developed a drug reaction related to one of his new medications may be a possibility but seems unlikely without the typical skin rash along with the fact that symptoms persisted even after discontinuing the potentially offending drugs.

7. Atypical pneumonia, possibly Chlamydia trachomatis or Mycoplasma pneumoniae: This could account for her respiratory symptoms but doesn't explain the renal findings.

8. Goodpasture's syndrome: This is an autoimmune disease that can affect lungs and kidneys, leading to symptoms of respiratory infection and kidney disease. But it typically presents with more severe respiratory distress.

9. Tuberculosis (TB): While TB can have a wide range of presentations, her lack of known exposure and results of negative interferon-γ release assay makes this less likely.

10. Bacterial endocarditis: This can potentially cause a range of symptoms, including glomerulonephritis, but the lack of murmur or other stigmata makes it less probable."
PMID_35704485-case-prior-to-discussion.txt	Unfortunately, diagnosis is often delayed, and patients may be wheelchair-bound or bedbound by  the time of diagnosis. The tumor can be found  almost anywhere in the body, is usually benign,  and can be removed or ablated, although it can  recur years later. Tumor-induced osteomalacia is  the most likely diagnosis in this patient. I suspect that the diagnostic test was assessment for  an elevated blood level of FGF23, followed by  imaging studies to identify a tumor. It is prudent  to make a biochemical or genetic diagnosis of  tumor-induced osteomalacia before performing  imaging studies, because the tumor can occur  anywhere in the body and false positive imaging  studies are common.	"Most Likely Diagnosis: 
Osteomalacia due to chronic hypophosphatemia.

Differential Diagnoses Ranked by Probability:
1. Osteomalacia due to chronic hypophosphatemia.
2. Vitamin D deficiency rickets (osteomalacia).
3. Tumor Induced Osteomalacia (TIO).
4. Fibrous dysplasia.
5. Hypophosphatasia.
6. Chronic Kidney Disease-Mineral Bone Disorder (CKD-MBD).
7. Primary hyperparathyroidism.
8. Secondary hyperparathyroidism due to Vitamin D Deficiency.
9. Paget's disease of bone. 
10. Multiple myeloma.
11. Metastatic bone disease."

I would opt for ultrasonography in this young patient in order to avoid exposure to the radiation that is inherent with CT  and radionuclide scans. How does the finding of hyperparathyroidism  influence the diagnosis of the mandibular mass?  The possibility of the diagnosis of an atypical  ossifying fibroma is increased, given its occurrence in the context of hyperparathyroidism due  to  CDC73  mutations. Nevertheless, brown tumors  are a complication of hyperparathyroidism, and  the reported biopsy and radiographic findings  are more consistent with this type of lesion.	"Most Likely Diagnosis: Osteosarcoma of the mandible

The arthralgias, fever, presence of  anti-Ro antibodies, abnormal results on liverfunction tests, and elevated ferritin level seen in  this patient are common in patients with anti– MDA-5 dermatomyositis. I suspect that the most likely diagnosis in  this patient is anti–MDA-5 dermatomyositis. To  establish this diagnosis, I would review the results of the muscle biopsy and test for antibodies  directed against myositis-associated autoantigens,  including MDA-5.	"Most Likely Diagnosis: Disseminated coccidioidomycosis 

Differential Diagnosis: 

1. Disseminated coccidioidomycosis
2. Systemic lupus erythematosus
