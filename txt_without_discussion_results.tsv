Because fat droplets are compliant enough to  pass through the pulmonary capillary bed and  embolize to the central nervous system even in  the absence of a patent foramen ovale, the diagnosis of fat embolism syndrome occurring after  the liposuction procedure best explains this patient’s combination of lung injury, diffuse alveolar hemorrhage, and cerebral injury.	"Based on the case given, my most likely diagnosis would be Opioid Toxicity due to the excessive use of postoperative oxycodone.

My differential diagnoses, ranked by their likelihood would be:

1. Opioid Toxicity: The stupor and respiratory depression seen in the patient indicate an opioid overdose. 

2. Anesthetic-Induced Neurotoxicity: The array of anesthesia administered along with the patient's mental status suggest possible neurotoxicity.

3. Serotonin Syndrome: This could have happened due to the possible interaction between the tramadol and other drugs used.

4. Acute Respiratory Distress Syndrome (ARDS): The respiratory failure seen could suggest ARDS.

5. Surgical Site Infection / Septic Shock: This could come from the abdominoplasty and liposuction recently performed.

6. Neuroleptic Malignant Syndrome: The use of several medications in the postoperative period may have led to this.

7. Propofol Infusion Syndrome: The use of propofol in the patient's anesthetic could potentially precipitate this syndrome, but it's rather low on the list due to its rarity. 

8. Acute Pulmonary Embolism: Given the recent surgery and use of enoxaparin for clot prevention, this is a possibility, but other symptoms may be present.

9. Hypoxic–Ischemic Brain Injury: The low oxygen saturation level could suggest this, but other symptoms may be present. 

10. Anticholinergics toxicity: The use of scopolamine patch could be a reason for the toxicity and subsequent respiratory failure and altered mental state.

Differential Diagnosis Ranked by Probability:

1. Post-transplant Thrombotic Microangiopathy (TMA): Given the patient's history of renal transplantation, thrombocytopenia, diarrhea and bloody stools as well as anemia, this condition is probable. The reduction in platelet count and hemoglobin, absence of schistocytes on peripheral smear are indicative.

2. Hemolytic Uremic Syndrome (HUS): This disease presented with thrombocytopenia and anemia may also cause similar symptoms such as diarrhea and bloody stools.

3. Immune Thrombocytopenic Purpura (ITP): The profound thrombocytopenia, along with bleeding symptoms, could be indicative of this disease but absence of schistocytes makes it less likely.

4. Graft vs Host Disease (GVHD): It’s a plausible diagnosis considering the patient’s transplantation history. The symptoms such as diarrhea may point towards GI involvement, though not fully consistent overall.

5. Drug-induced thrombocytopenia: Given her recent transplant and the multiple medications, there is potential for this, but it would not typically present with GI bleeding.

6. CMV Colitis: Given her transplantation history, this condition is plausible, but the lack of systemic symptoms and the aforementioned findings make it less likely.

7. Alport Syndrome Related Complication: The patient was presumed to have alport syndrome prior to kidney transplant which could possibly have presented itself in a different form post transplant, however this is less likely."

Differential Diagnosis:
1. Transthyretin Cardiac Amyloidosis (ATTR): Transthyretin, previously called prealbumin, is a protein produced by the liver that can misfold and deposit, thereby causing amyloidogenesis. A hereditary version (hATTR) or wild type (ATTRwt/formerly referred to as senile amyloidosis) can be the underlying cause. 
2. Hypertrophic Cardiomyopathy: With its hereditary nature taken into account, it is a valid differential, especially due to the left ventricular hypertrophy found in echocardiographs. The presence of interventricular block may suggest infiltrative HCM.
3. Light Chain (AL) Amyloidosis: Though less common in the elderly, it must be considered due to the potential for false negatives from serum protein electrophoresis.
4. Fabry Disease: This condition can cause left ventricular hypertrophy, arrhythmias, and kidney disease, but the lack of a specific symptom, like angiokeratomas, decreases its likelihood.
5. Anderson-Fabry Disease: A systemic disorder that also presents with restrictive and hypertrophic cardiomyopathy along with kidney disease. Typically persons effected also present with neuropathy, which this patient does not.
6. Sarcoidosis: Systemic symptoms and findings mentioned do not meet the criteria, but cardiac involvement can result in biventricular hypertrophy and arrhythmias, so it cannot be entirely ruled out.

The underlying principles are  that persons with psychiatric disorders need to  be identified and connected with appropriate psychiatric care and that the distress of other members of affected populations is best addressed  through psychosocial interventions, such as psychological first aid, without labeling the normative responses to disaster trauma as abnormal.  This patient will benefit from observation for  the development of a recurrent depressive or anxiety disorder, as well as attention to address her  understandable emotional distress. A mental  health professional can assess any psychiatric  illness that may develop and can assist in the  psychosocial aspects of her recovery from her  illness through psychotherapeutic interventions  including psychosocial support, education, reassurance, and assistance with resumption of her  previous level of functioning. In my opinion, this patient is having understandable psychosocial distress in the context  of a serious medical illness during the Covid-19  pandemic. The key to understanding this case is  to acknowledge that this patient’s distress is a  normative response and does not meet criteria  for a psychiatric diagnosis.

PMID_35081284-txt_without_discussion.txt	Children with IBD often “fall  off” the growth curve long before the diagnosis  is made. An early sign of growth failure is a  decrease in height velocity. The most likely diagnosis in this patient is  IBD. His initial vague gastrointestinal symptoms  are atypical of this condition; however, arthralgias and oral aphthous ulcers are both common  extraintestinal manifestations. He did not have  frankly bloody stools, which could explain why  the hemoglobin level was only mildly decreased.  The decreased albumin level and mildly elevated  lipase level are consistent with a diagnosis of  IBD, and the elevated levels of inflammatory  markers support the diagnosis. Several features of this patient’s presentation  give me pause. Presentation with arthralgias as  the dominant symptom and with only mild gastrointestinal symptoms is highly unusual, as is  the fact that the most affected joint was his  shoulder. Also, he did not have a history of weight  loss or growth failure; the absence of these features suggests a recent and rapid onset of illness. Despite his somewhat unusual presentation,  I think IBD is the most likely diagnosis in this  case. To establish this diagnosis, I would perform colonoscopy and upper endoscopy.

On the basis of the patient’s presentation  with persistent hypoglycemia in the context of a  probable sacrococcygeal teratoma, I suspect that  the Sotos syndrome is the most likely diagnosis.  To establish this diagnosis, targeted sequencing  should be performed to identify variants in  NSD1 . Alternatively, whole-exome sequencing  could be performed in the infant, as well as in  the parents if possible (trio approach), to identify pathogenic variants associated with genetic  disorders that could be consistent with the patient’s clinical presentation, including the Sotos  syndrome.
